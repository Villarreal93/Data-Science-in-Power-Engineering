# Data Science in Power Engineering
This repository is intended for the assignments of the course "Data Science in Power Engineering" at Warsaw University of Technology. The main objective of the course is to teach students how to use SQL, Python, and ML techniques to solve real engineering problems.

## Deliverables
All assignments are coded in Jupyter notebooks, while deliverables were mostly HTML files barring a couple of exceptions. For some tasks, the instructions without code are included as well as the solutions proposed by me.

## Glossary
The topics presented per homework are:

- Homework 1 - SQL, basic Pandas and Matplotlib
- Homework 2 - Clustering
- Homework 3 - Time Series Analysis
- Homework 4 - Aggregated Data
- Homework 5 - Artificial Neural Networks
- Homework 6 - Linear Regression
- Homework 7 - Optimization
