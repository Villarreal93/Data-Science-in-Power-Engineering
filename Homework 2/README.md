# Clustering 
This repository is intended for the second assignment of the course. The main topic discussed is clustering and this technique is used to detect anomalies in the data of 
operating CNC machines. The task also includes more advanced functions of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. At the end, the local outlier factor method is used to determine abnormal behavior of the CNC machine.
