#Step 1: Students Table creation
Create Table Students ("Student_ID","Name", "Surname", "Year of birth");
Insert into Students Values (0,"Alejandro", "Villarreal", 1993), 
(1,"Andrea", "Romero", 1993), (2,"Jorge", "Montalvo", 1994),
(3,"Hector", "Arrambide", 1994), (4,"Martha", "Caballero", 1991),
(5,"Fernando", "Garza", 1991);

#Step 2: Course Table creation
Create Table Courses ("Course_ID", "Name");
Insert into Courses Values (1111, "Data Science"), 
(2222, "Fluid Mechanics"), (3333, "Heat Transfer");

#Step 3: Registration Table creation
Create Table Registration ("Student_ID", "Course_ID");
Insert into Registration values (0,1111),(0,2222),(0,3333),
(1,2222),(1,3333),
(2,1111),(2,2222),(2,3333),
(3,1111),(3,2222),
(4,3333),
(5,2222);

#Step 4: Query to calculate number of students attending each course
Select Courses.Course_ID, count(Student_ID) from Registration
inner join Courses on Courses.Course_ID = Registration.Course_ID
Group by Courses.Course_ID;

#Step 5: Query to calculate number of courses each student attends to
Select Students.Student_ID, count(Course_ID) from Registration
inner join Students on Students.Student_ID = Registration.Student_ID
Group by Students.Student_ID;

#Step 6: Scores Table creation
Create Table Scores as
Select * from Registration;
Alter table Scores
Add Presentation;
Alter table Scores
Add Test;
Update Scores
Set Presentation=5, Test=4
where Course_ID=1111;
Update Scores
Set Presentation=4, Test=4
where Course_ID=2222;
Update Scores
Set Presentation=3, Test=3
where Course_ID=3333;

#Step 7: Query to show average final grade for each student
Select Registration.Student_ID, avg(Presentation), avg(Test), avg(Presentation+Test)/2 from Scores
inner join Registration on Registration.Student_ID = Scores.Student_ID
Group by Scores.Student_ID;

#Step 8: Query to show the grade of each student per course
Select Student_ID, Course_ID, Presentation, Test, (Presentation+Test)/2.0 from Scores;
