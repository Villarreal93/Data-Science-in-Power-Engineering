# Artificial Neural Networks
This folder is intended for the fifth assignment of the course. This assignment consisted in proposing three different experiments where a NN is modified to observe how output variables such as accuracy,  total execution time, and error change. For the first experiment I decided to compare the speed of the ANN using a CPU vs a GPU, then for the second experiment comparing the optimizers ADAM and SGD, finally on the third experiment the architecture of the NN is modified by adding one hidden layer. The deliverable is a small report PDF file where the results are presented.
